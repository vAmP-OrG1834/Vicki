    <h2 id = whyname>Why the name Operation 1834?</h2>
    <p>
        When you saw our name, what did you think? If you guessed that 1834 has something to do with the year,
        you're correct! 1834 is the year that Canada abolished (got rid of, for those that don't know the meaning)
        slavery - or so we thought. To this very day, slavery is still a thing, believe it or not, since human
        trafficking is a form of modern-day slavery, whether it be forced labor, sex slavery, or other.

    <h2 id = whatdo> Okay, but what do we do?</h2>
    <p>
        In short, we are a Canadian organization that spreads awareness about human trafficking.
        Human trafficking is a serious issue that can affect anyone. Honestly, it's not talked about enough.
        Think about it. When was the last time a friend or family member actually mentioned human trafficking in a conversation
        and both actually started thinking about it? When was the last time it came up in school during a lesson?
        That's what we're here to do. To educate you and others about this horrific crime.
    </p>


    <!-- Definition and explanation of human trafficking -->
    <h2 id = whatisht>So what even <em>is</em> human trafficking?</h2>
    <p>
        Simple explanation:
        Human trafficking is the second largest and fastest-growing crime in the world. It's also one of the most
        misunderstood ones because it affects many different people and involves other crimes, and happens in many
        locations as well. There are six main kinds of trafficking:

    <!--Why it is important to know-->
    <h2 id = whyimportant>Why is it important to educate/be educated about human trafficking?</h2>
    <p>
        If you're a parent or teacher reading this, you probably want to know <em>why</em> you should educate
        your child(ren)/students. There's a few reasons why, but the main one is because if your child(ren)/students
        know as much as they can about human trafficking, it'll be more likely that they'll see the signs of
        human trafficking and know if they are or someone else is a victim.

    <!-- Third question heading -->
    <h2 id = whichgroup>Which group of people are targeted the most and why?</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Women and children ; commonly considered the most vulnerable
        </li>
        <li>
            Migrants and refugees ; may not fully understand what the trafficker is doing
        </li>
        <li>
            People with disabilities and/or mental health challenges ; also may not fully understand what the trafficker is doing
        </li>
        <li>
            LGTBQ+ youth ; lured in by promise of a safe and accepting enviroment
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        One thing all victims have in common is vulnerability. Think about it. If someone were to traffick someone else,
        do you think that they would rather go after someone invulnerable, or vulnerable? The latter? Yeah, I thought so
        too.
